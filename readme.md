# Benchmark for prototyping msbuild with faster static-graph/caching

Simple benchmark to test hosting msbuild in a "server" like mode, with improvements to msbuild to make it 
build a graph of projects a lot more faster.

This is to measure the raw cost of msbuild when compiling a tree of deep projects:
- Clean, build all
- Touch 1 C# file in the root project, build all
- Change 1 C# file affecting ref assemblies in the leaf project, build all
- No changes, build all

This repository is using a fork of msbuild [here](https://github.com/xoofx/msbuild/tree/benchbuild) to achieve higher build performance by enabling parallelized builds + caching 
while today msbuild can do caching only sequential and single threaded (see this [issue](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/7112))

## Why?

Today, msbuild is used mostly dynamically to evaluate build graphs and execute targets.

Recently was introduced a new way to build projects with msbuild by using [static graphs](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/documentation/specs/static-graph.md#static-graph)

Static graphs are great because they provide the knowledge up-front of the entire project graph to compile,
and this allows to schedule more efficiently the build of projects.

With the static-graph mode, msbuild has introduced an `isolate` project mode:

- Usually, when you compile a Project A that has many project dependencies (B1, B2...), building project A
with msbuild will require msbuild to issue lots of msbuild tasks to query build result metadatas from 
project dependencies (e.g `B1.GetTargetFrameworks`). The problem is that calling msbuild on each dependencies
can be very costly because it requires to load all the target files associated to a project, evaluate all the properties...etc.
- With the isolate mode, you can create a cache of a project that would contain the results of these metadatas.
 You could then build Project A by reusing caches for their dependencies (e.g B1.csproj.cache)

But the design of `isolate` was made in a specific case (see this [issue](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/7112)) 
that was forcing the compilation of each projects sequentially and from a single thread. So you couldn't 
build an entire graph of projects in reverse order of topological sort in parallel.

This repo validates the idea by bringing to msbuild a way to use isolated builds on msbuild nodes, so 
that we can now build caches in // while building projects.

The performance improvements can be dramatic. For example, for a tree of 100 C# projects (a root project, several layers 
of child projects, and a single leaf project referenced by all children), the full build of these projects takes:

- 7s to 9s with Visual Studio/msbuild.
- 1.5 to 2s with the solution experimented in this repository.

When re-compiling a root project referencing the other 99 C# projects:

- 1.5s with Visual Studio/msbuild
- 150ms with the solution experimented.

So the solution in this experiment brings almost a **speedup factor of x3 to x10 in build time**.

## Building

- First, you need to be very brave ðŸ˜… 
- The code assumes that you have installed [dotnet 6.0.100 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)
- Assuming that you checkout this project in a $root folder (so `$root\BenchBuild`)
- You need to checkout this msbuild [benchbuild](https://github.com/xoofx/msbuild/tree/benchbuild) branch in `$root\dotnet\msbuild`
- Open the `$root\dotnet\msbuild\MSBuild.sln` solution and compile in `Release` (and/or `Debug`) the `MSBuild` project (other project might fail)
- Open the `$root\BenchBuild\BenchBuild.sln` and build the solution (in the same config than msbuild)
- Then you can run `BenchBuild` in the solution
- You should see an output similar to this:
